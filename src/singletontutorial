/* 
how to create a singleton:

in the class, create a new private static instance of the Object (same name as the class), but do not instantiate it. Then create a 
constructor for the class, in which you will have a conditional. If there is no current instance of the Object, then instantiate the
new instance. Finally, return the instance.

Here's what that might look like:

public class Singleton {

	private static Singleton instance; (creates Singleton instance but does not give it a value)

	public static Singleton {

		if (instance == null) { (conditional. if there is no instance, then instantiate a new one.)
			instance = new Singleton();
		}

	return instance; (return the instance :->)
	}
}

public class AccountManager {

	private static AccountManager instance; // (creates Singleton instance but does not give it a value)

	public static AccountManager {

		if (instance == null) { //(conditional. if there is no instance, then instantiate a new one.)
			instance = new AccountManager();
		}

	    return AccountManager; //(return the instance :->)
	}
}
